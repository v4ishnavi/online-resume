                <h4>Optimization of Control in a 2-Link Robotic Manipulator Using Advanced Controllers - Systems
                    Thinking, 2.1, IIIT-H</h4>
                <p>In the project, advanced control strategies were developed for a 2-link robotic manipulator, focusing
                    on precise position
                    control through torque modulation. The dynamics of the manipulator were modeled using state
                    functions and variables,
                    and the control was optimized using PI, PD, and PID controllers to address its complex, non-linear
                    behavior. The project
                    involved simulations in MATLAB-Simulink to validate the effectiveness of these control strategies,
                    demonstrating a
                    blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application in robotics and control systems. This
                    project can accurately
                    model the working, stability and control of a 2-link robotic arm, as an example.

                </h4>
                <p>This project applied linear algebra and rudimentary machine learning techniques to enhance investment
                    strategy
                    analysis. Using Python, it focused on Mean-Variance Optimization and matrix operations, including
                    multiplication and
                    inversion, to evaluate financial models. The project drew on key studies like "Risk-Based Portfolios
                    with Large Dynamic
                    Covariance Matrices" and "Stock Price Prediction Using Regression Analysis" for methodological
                    insights. The primary
                    goals were to refine financial decision-making, advance risk assessment methods, and achieve a
                    balanced risk-return
                    ratio in portfolio management. By integrating mathematical approaches with machine learning
                    algorithms, the project
                    offered innovative tools for optimizing asset allocation, effectively quantifying risk factors, and
                    constructing
                    comprehensive risk models, thus facilitating more informed and strategic financial planning and
